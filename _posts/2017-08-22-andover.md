A fresh faced young sobo showed up at the hostel. She asked if I was heading back out today, and after I affirmed she asked, "are you excited??" I stared blankly back at her. It was like being asked if you're excited to go back to your desk to work after taking a long lunch break. Excitement had not even crossed my mind when thinking about things I might feel in that moment. Imagine working on a project 11 hours a day 6 days a week. Your whole life is built around it. It's not just a project. It's your life. It's what you do. It's who you are (for the moment at least). Returning to the trail doesn't feel exciting, it feels inevitable. It felt like a lot to burden such an eager young person with the reality of what doing something like this day in and day out actually feels like, so I just said "yeah, sure, I'm excited."
