Today was an interesting day. It started with beautiful view from Max Patch, a grassy summit with doing views of the surrounding mountains:

At the top I was greeted by a pair of thru hikers who did the trail last year and had an incredible spread of fruits, vegetables, and mini donuts. As I was sitting there taking in the view and shooting the shit with Yogi and Hatmandu, the wind picked up and it started to snow!

I hustled off the top of the mountain, but the snow did not let up:

The shelter I had planned to stay at was near the top of Walnut Mountain, and when I got there and found myself alone and the snow still swirling I decided to call in the greatest bit of trail magic I have yet experienced. I asked for a pickup. I had been planning to meet up with Erika and Ryan in Hot Springs the next day, but with my second pair of socks on my hands as mittens it felt like the right time. I hiked 7 more miles over Bluff Mountain and reached the road just as they started walking out to find me. We were also able to give a lift to a fellow thru hiker (Longwalker) who I met coming down the mountain. 

Some days hiking this trail makes me feel incredibly capable and self-sufficient, and some days it reminds me how great it is to have people in my life (strangers and friends) who are there to help out and back me up when things get shitty.
