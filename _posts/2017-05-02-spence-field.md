A logistical note: the location of a post is always where I am/was/will be the morning of the date.

I feel like that sentence didn't make it clearer at all, but at least I tried.

For anyone closely following this (hi mom and dad!) I am going to try to add some content to older posts and keep up with locations better going forward. I have a fully functional phone again! But still no promises.
