Written on the wall of the privy of the Manassas Gap Shelter:

> "if you live in the past you are depressed
if you live in the future you are anxious
if you live in the present you are at peace"

A little something to think about next time you're taking a poop.


Also, written in the log book that stated on the cover it would be preserved for posterity on the PATC archives:

> "I \<3 man assas"


Lots of profound stuff going on at this shelter.
