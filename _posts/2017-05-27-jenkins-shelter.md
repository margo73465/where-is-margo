Had some interesting trail conversation today, including a discussion of how knowing the vocabulary of a group can make it much easier to gain trust and become a part of the group. Some groups have very complex vocabularies (i.e. neuroscientists), but we all agreed it would be possible to teach trail vocab in under 5 minutes, so here is your lesson:

(NOTE: This list of words includes commonly accepted trail words and also some words I just think are funny and which may or may not have been made up by people hiking around me)

- **zero (noun):** a day when you walk zero miles
- **nearo (noun):** a day when you walk nearly zero miles (commonly anything under 10)
- **slackpack (verb):** when you get to walk without the full weight of your pack. Commonly achieved by paying a hostel owner to drop you down trail and walking back to the hostel, but can be come across in other magical ways.
- **snackpack (verb):** similar to slackpacking, but the small day pack you carry with you must contain only snacks (usage can be broadened to refer to any time the majority of the weight in your pack is snacks, aka me comimg out of every town)
- **day hiker (noun):** someone who goes hiking for one day and then goes home and showers and sleeps in a bed
- **section hiker (noun):** someone who is hiking a section of the trail and plans to ultimately complete the entire thing in pieces. Though often very wonderful, section hikers are known to be heartbreakers because they will inevitably leave just when things get good
- **LASHer (noun):** stands for Long Ass Section Hiker. similar to a regular section hiker, but the potential for heartbreak is even higher
- **thru hiker (noun):** one who plans to complete the entire trail in a calendar year
- **vitamin I (noun):** ibuprofen
- **hiker midnight (noun):** sundown or 9pm, whichever comes first. The great big "lights out" for the earth
- **surface shitter (noun):** deeply offensive hiker insult used to refer to those who don't bury their poop in a cathole in accordance with proper Leave No Trace (LNT) etiquette
- **dirty 30 (noun):** a challenge in which a hiker does not bathe or do laundry for 30 days
- **hiker trash (noun):** hikers who do things not usually considered socially acceptable (i.e. buying groceries and then sitting down right outside the store and repackaging everything while drinking half a gallon of chocolate milk. Almost all thru hikers are hiker trash)
- **white blazer (noun):** one who walks past every white blaze on the trail, a purist
- **yellow blazer (noun):** one who "took off their purist panties a few hundred miles ago" and walks most of the trail, but might circumstantially miss a spot here or there
- **pink  blazer (noun):** one who alters the schedule of their hike to romantically pursue another hiker
- **aqua blazer (noun):** one who canoes down the Shenandoah River instead of walking through the national park
- **brown blazer (noun):** one who only camps at sites equipped with a privy ()
