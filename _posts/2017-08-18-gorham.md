I celebrated four months on the trail at an all you can eat (AYCE) Chinese buffet in Gorham. There was a time in the trail when I loved a good Chinese buffet, but they have started to make me sad. I used to feel confident in my ability make any such establishment regret allowing me to eat all that I can. The joy first started to dwindle when my now tiny stomach would fill up after just a plate or two, before even considering dessert. Nowadays it's even worse. I told my a fellow hiker, "I am tried of eating." He responded "that doesn't make any sense, eating cause more positive neural activity than almost anything else. The brain was literally made to enjoy eating." Me: "Shit. I am really fucked up." Because I am tired. I'm tired of having to do it all the time, physically chewing, the sensation of fullness. Things still taste good, but I feel unmotivated to pursue eating. I eat still. I'm nearly always hungry. Satisfying that hunger just doesn't give me the same joy anymore. It's weird.
